# vector-graphics-editor
The following application is one of the obligatory project for the Computer Graphics 1 course at the Warsaw University of Technology, academic year 2020/2021.

## Application
The purpose of this project is to create an application for creating simple graphics. The application has to provide the following possibilities to the user:
- Option to draw a line by choosing two points on the screen
- Option to draw a circle by choosing first the center of the circle, and then the radius 
- Option to draw polygons by choosing all the points of it until the user clicks near the starting point
- Option to draw rectangle by choosing two opposite points
- Option to move points, edges or vertices of the above figures
- Option to choose color of the lines, polygons, rectangles and circles
- Option to choose thickness of the lines, polygons and rectangles
- Option to use anty-aliasing algorithm for lines and circle, based on the Xiaolin Wu algorithm
- Option to fill the polygons with solid color or loaded images, based on the Active Edge Table algorithm
- Option to clip the polygons, based on the Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm

# To do list
The following options need to be implemented
- Polygon filling 
- Creating rectangles
